## üöÄ Introduction

This project was developed as part of a course on digital design and FPGA development at Georgia Tech. The Clap Counter Peripheral is designed to interface with the SCOMP processor, processing audio data to detect claps (or snaps) and count them accurately. The design is focused on robustness and configurability, making it adaptable to various environments and use cases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **VHDL**: Hardware description language used to design the clap counter peripheral.
- **ModelSim**: Simulation tool used to verify the VHDL code.
- **Quartus Prime/Xilinx ISE**: FPGA development tools for synthesis and implementation.
- **SCOMP Processor**: A simple computer processor model used as the core CPU for interfacing with the peripheral.

## üèóÔ∏è Design Overview

### Device Functionality

The Clap Counter Peripheral processes audio signals from a microphone and provides two outputs to the SCOMP processor:
1. **Clap Count**: A 15-bit unsigned vector representing the number of claps detected since the last reset.
2. **Clap Signal**: A single bit that toggles whenever a clap is detected.

### API

The peripheral's interface is designed to be straightforward, with the clap count and signaling bit forming the core of the API. Users can configure the loudness threshold through the SCOMP‚Äôs IO bus, ensuring that the peripheral only detects claps that exceed a specified loudness.

### Configurable Thresholds

Users can set the loudness threshold using the 10 LSBs of the SCOMP‚Äôs IO bus. The peripheral stops detecting claps when the MSB of the input is set to high. This design allows the peripheral to operate in various environments by adjusting the sensitivity to sound.

### State Machine Implementation

The transition from a nested if-statement logic to a state machine was a critical design decision. The state machine improves code readability, debuggability, and maintainability. It operates in three states:
1. **Start Timer**: Initiates the timer when the audio average exceeds the loud threshold.
2. **Stop Timer**: Halts the timer when the audio falls below the quiet threshold.
3. **Clap Detection**: Checks the duration of the noise to confirm if it was a clap and increments the counter.

### Moving Averager

To filter out small fluctuations in the audio signal, which could lead to false detections, the peripheral uses a moving average of the past 32 samples of the audio data. This approach smooths out the input and improves the accuracy of clap detection.

üìù Clap Counter Peripheral Design Review
Ashan Deen
Submitted April 24th, 2023

Introduction
This document contains information on the peripheral‚Äôs functions, their implementation, and the reasoning behind the implementation. The robustness of the snap detection of not overcounting snaps was prioritized along with ease of code formatting, followed by documentation of VHDL code and project as well as assembly coding.

All deliverables of the proposal being a snap counter, snap detection, and configurable thresholds were met except for using a toggle bit instead of a flag bit for snap detection as the external program could never latch on to the flag bit whenever it was high.

Note: Snap and clap are used interchangeably in the document.

Device Functionality
API: The audio peripheral processes external audio from a microphone and provides two pieces of information to SCOMP: a 15-bit unsigned vector containing the number of claps detected since last reset and a clap signaling bit. The peripheral toggles the LSB whenever it detects a clap and increments the clap count by one.

Configurable Thresholds: The user can set a loudness threshold using the ten LSBs of SCOMP‚Äôs IO bus. The peripheral stops detecting claps when the MSB of the input is set to high. A special case of our peripheral is when the loud threshold is set below the quiet threshold, which results in rapid incrementation of the counter while sound is below the quiet threshold.

Design Decisions and Implementation
Timer: The timer is in a separate process to make it independent of the state machine. The timer uses an external 10 Hz clock instead of the system clock to put the duration between ticks within an order of magnitude of the duration of a standard clap.

Moving Averager: To filter out small fluctuations in the audio, which could cause false detections, the hardware keeps a running average of the past 32 samples of AUD_DATA using a shift register. This average is used as input to the state machine.

Input Processor: This process formats the input data from SCOMP in a way that can be used as the loud threshold. The peripheral expects a binary number input within the first 10 LSBs, which is
